## Pace of innovation is mostly driven by the community involved in it

Open source innovates faster, spreads faster, does great work faster than any single company can.

Curated list of all the available open source business model options, pros and cons, example companies using it, lot of references. 

1. **Open-Core Model**: Have an open source core and sell closed source features on top of it like enterprise features, hosted services etc. they will add value added user experiences, services, features, extension.

   **Companies that did this**: *Sugar CRM*, *GitLab*, *Confluence*, *Elastic* 

   **Cons**: 
     1. You surrender the contribution of the global community
     2. Your closed source features should be better than the rest of the planet combined
     3. As closed source featues will be maintained without community there is chanece of it decaying over time
     2. Burden of balancing what should be paid feature and what should be free.

   **Pros**:
     1. One of the most used in open source business models
     2. Most of the commercial software companies implemented this 
     
2. **Code on the top**: Take an open source project, secretly add your enhancements, make it way better and share it or sell it for money by making it a proprietary software. 

   **Companies that did this**: Illustra took postgres project and made it better and sold it as paid software. 

   **Cons**:  
     1. You surrender the contribution of the global community
     2. You should be better than the rest of the planet combined. 
     3. Factor of success decays over time if code is being maintained without community

   **Pros**:

2. **SAAS/Open source as a service**: Hosted offering of an open source code, Commertilaizes hosting, tooling and operations. 

3. **Version lagging**: Last version is freely available but the current version or for the latest version you need to pay
   
   **Companies that did this**:

   **Cons**:
     1. add here 

   **Pros**:
     1. Developer want the latest and the greatest



5. **Service Model**: Subscription Model(extended support, guaranteed updates etc) Consultancy. Software is free but clients need to pay for any consulting, professional support, deployment, management service etc. 

   **Companies that did this**: Mysql, Jboss, Redhat (they sell support sla, insurance policy)

   **Cons**: 
     1. Won’t get high margins with service based company
     2. You tend to make less investment to make the core product better
     3. So the product becomes languish over the time
     4. Very hard to scale operationally. 

   **Pros**:
     1. Most of the cons are solved by RedHat and then nailed. 
    
    
6. **Dual licensing**: Pay us money and you don’t need to make your software open source or make it open source and do not need to pay. 
   
   **Companies that did this**: Sleepycat, MySql has this (adobe bought this), (maxscale proxy from MariaDB, Landoop apache kafka tools)-- these are using business source licensing. 

   **Cons**: 
     1. Business model itself is based on a threat.. And it's not a healthy model I guess!!
     2. Relationship with customers is not that strong here!
     3. You have to do frequent releases here! And continuous innovation is must

   **Pros**:
     1. Mysql got almost 70% income from licensing. They would have never got that much income w/o licensing. 
     2. You can introduce business source soln, better than open core, removes one vendor problem and code will eventually be free
     3. Investor friendly cause you know the there will client will be forced to pay for some licensing
     4. Development and making the core product better and innovation will always continue. 
     5. Really high margin 90% plus margin which can grow company very fast (same guy is saying its 90% plus margin for open-core in this)
    
    
7. Making hard line b/w proprietary and open source software. Own a proprietary software and at the same time keep contributing to the open source community. 

   **Companies that did this**: Cloudera, IBM lot of other companies

   **Cons**:
     1.    

   **Pros**:
     1. Proprietary software gets us recurring revenue which can be invest back in open source. 
     2. It creates a reason for customer to come to us


8. Having non-profit foundation fund for the development:

   **Companies that did this**:

   Cons: 
     1. Very less freedom for development and to own up
     2. Very difficult run it as commercial. 

   Pros:
     1. 
     2. 
    
    
9. Paid development (Custom development):

   **Companies that did this**: Gitlab tried it

   **Cons**:  
     1. Companies opting for this would already have setup for doing the custom changes and it won’t work well and for gitlab it was to just review rather than getting paid. 

   **Pros**: 
     1. Only based on the open donation
